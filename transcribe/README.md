## Setup

Create two seperate aws lambda functions, one for creating the transcription job and another for getting the transcription.
Copy code from create_transcribe_job.py file for creating transcription job.
Copy code from get_transcription.py file for getting transcription.
Refactor the code little bit if you want to run it locally.
